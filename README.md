# Movie Recommendation System
This is a simple movie recommendation system implemented in Python. The system computes the similarity between movies based on user ratings and uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction.

## Description

The movie recommendation system utilizes a ratings matrix and SVD to provide recommendations for a selected movie. It computes the similarity between movies and returns the top N similar movies based on user ratings. This system can be used to get recommendations for any movie present in the dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries (NumPy and Pandas).
3. Modify the `movie_id`, `k`, and `top_n` variables in the script to get recommendations for a specific movie.
4. Execute the script to view the recommended movies for the selected movie.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
